## Proposal
We propose a game where we try to launch a marshmallow into a group of mugs filled with hot chocolate. If a marshmallow lands in a mug of hot chocolate, the mug will be taken out of the group. The goal is to get rid of all the mugs of hot chocolate before running out of marshmallows. The user will be able to control the direction with the right and left arrow keys and the intensity of the throw with the up and down arrow keys. 

## Technical Features
The advanced graphics features that our game will implement include physics-based simulation, object collision, and shadows. Physics-based simulation involves modeling the marshmallow motion as a projectile to determine the trajectory of its path. Object collision detects if the marshmallow hits the table, a cup edge, or into the hot chocolate drink, and stops the motion accordingly. Finally, all objects will cast shadows. 

## User Interaction
Left/Right Arrow: Aim marshmallow left/right
Up/Down Arrow: Increase/decrease power
Space: Throw marshmallow


## Stretch Goals
If time permits, we will make our game for two players. Once the first ball is thrown, the camera will move to the point of view of the other player.
